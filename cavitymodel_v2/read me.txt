% combining the momentum_submit.m and model_submit.m before into one file.
% limiting the integration error to decrease the running time.
% add the 3-D distribution functions (PSD and energy flux)
% The total time spent now is near half an hour.

Run the demo.m

The code_submit.m is the same as before, which provides the profiles of electromagnetic fields (saved in data_end.mat)
For the momentum_submit.m, substitute the results into the distribution functions 
and then integrate them to get the momentums, kept in the line_data.mat.

We newly provide an example to plot the profiles of both the field and plasma profiles.

Because the distributions are all Maxwellian in the vz direction, so the simplified integrations are all 2-D.
We provide the 3-D velocity distributions in the final part, which may help to plot the PADs.
